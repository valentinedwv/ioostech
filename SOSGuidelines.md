# Web Service Description Document (WSDD) #

The WSDD v1.0 along with other documents (XML templates and test suite) that constitute the IOOS SOS Application Profile 1.0 is now located on [GitHub Web site](http://ioos.github.io/sos-guidelines), which is currently the sole source of the IOOS SOS Profile v1.0 information.

# DEPRECATED MATERIAL #

The last draft release of the [IOOS SOS Milestone 1.0 WSDD v0.91](https://ioostech.googlecode.com/files/IOOS%20SOS%20WSDD%20Draft%20v0.91.docx) and [earlier version of the Guidelines](OutdatedSOSguidelines.md) contain the outdated description of the IOOS SOS Profile v1.0. Although these documents had been deprecated, they have been preserved just for completeness until this Wiki shutdown.
