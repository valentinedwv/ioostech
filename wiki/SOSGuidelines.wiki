= Introduction =

The [http://code.google.com/p/ioostech/w ioostech wiki] contains many deliberations on the issues associated with SOS implementation.  This page serves as the table of contents or introduction for the decisions or commitments that result from the various discussions.  In other words, much of the wiki discusses what one could do, but the SOSGuidelines, document what you should do.  

This may relate to or perhaps will become the IOOS SOS Interface Definition Document.

IOOS data from fixed and mobile observing platforms can be obtained over the internet using the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) specification published by the Open Geospatial Consortium. An SOS has three basic operations:

  * GetCapabilities provides summary information about the service and about the platforms for which it provides data.
  * DescribeSensor provides descriptions of individual sensors, platforms supporting one or more sensors, and networks of related platforms.
  * GetObservation provides time-series data from one or more sensors on one or more platforms.

= SOS Requests (IDD) =
_Recommendation:_ Use the [http://www.oostethys.org/best-practices/best-practices-get OOSTethys 2008 "Best Practices SOS HTTP GET Request" document] as our starting point for a template IDD. Move it to our wiki, edit it as needed (updates, cleanups, etc), then adapt existing representative SOS services (NDBC, NOS-COOPS, maybe NANOOS and other volunteers) using the template.

Go to the specific sections:
  * [GetCapabilities#Interface_Definition_Document_(IDD) GetCapabilities]
  * [DescribeSensor#Interface_Definition_Document_(IDD) DescribeSensor]
  * [GetObservation#Interface_Definition_Document_(IDD) GetObservation]

Examples, starting points:
  * [http://sdf.ndbc.noaa.gov/sos/ NDBC SOS]
  * [http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/ioos-dif-sos/parameters.jsp NOS-COOPS SOS]
  * [http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html#Service USGS Water Services] (not SOS, but based on WaterML 1 and related services
  * [NANOOSNVSPythonSOS NANOOS SOS]
  * [https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Sensornet/SosOperations 52North Example]
  * Eric Bridger's OOSTethys/IOOS Perl server code?

Currently the interface descriptions for the two core IOOS SOS implementations (NDBC and NOS-COOPS) are quite different, as can be seen from the links above. Beyond any differences in actual implementations, using a common template description for describing the SOS services across providers is an achievable goal and would go a long way towards facilitating the development of common service and client software.

= Standards and Specifications =

The versions of the international standards and specifications used in the IOOS SOS implementation.

|| *Specification Name* || *Version Number* || *Comments* ||
||Sensor Observation Service || 1.0 || With some extensions ||
|| Observations & Measurements || 1.0 || ||
|| SWE Common || 1.0 || ||

Discussion
Though it is clear that O&M version 2.0 is coupled with SOS Version 2.0 it is not clear that the same relationship exists for SWE Common 2.0. From initial inspection, it seems that SWE Common 2.0 has already been absorbed into the data packaging component of the 52 North SOS 1.0 version.
