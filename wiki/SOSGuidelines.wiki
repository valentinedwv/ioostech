= Introduction =

The [http://code.google.com/p/ioostech/w ioostech wiki] contains many deliberations on the issues associated with SOS implementation.  This page serves as the table of contents or introduction for the decisions or commitments that result from the various discussions.  In other words, much of the wiki discusses what one could do, but the SOSGuidelines, document what you should do.  

This may relate to or perhaps will become the IOOS SOS Interface Definition Document.

IOOS data from fixed and mobile observing platforms can be obtained over the internet using the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) specification published by the Open Geospatial Consortium. An SOS has three basic operations:

  * GetCapabilities provides summary information about the service and about the platforms for which it provides data.
  * DescribeSensor provides descriptions of individual sensors, platforms supporting one or more sensors, and networks of related platforms.
  * GetObservation provides time-series data from one or more sensors on one or more platforms.


= Standards and Specifications =

The versions of the international standards and specifications used in the IOOS SOS implementation.

|| Specification Name || Version Number || References ||
||O & M|| 1.0 || ||
|| Observations & Measurements || 2.0 || ||

OGC SWE Common 2.0 Standard - http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=41157
Discussion
Though it is clear that O&M version 2.0 is coupled with SOS Version 2.0 it is not clear that the same relationship exists for SWE Common 2.0. From initial inspection, it seems that SWE Common 2.0 has already been absorbed into the data packaging component of the 52 North SOS 1.0 version.
