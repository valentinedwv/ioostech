#summary List of web services of interest for harvesting into one or more IOOS services.
#labels Featured,Resources,Examples

= Introduction =

There are numerous web services in existence that can be harvested into IOOS services.  For example, the IOOS Data Portal routinely harvests from several federal or non federal web services that are distinct from the RA web services.  Similarly, the IOOS profile of the 52 North SOS server will harvest from select web services out of the box.  The list below is a collection of web services that are of interest or currently being harvested into one or more IOOS services (i.e. a regional SOS or the data portal).  The hope is that the IOOS community can begin to share code for common activities.

= Source SOS Injectors =
https://github.com/axiomalaska/source-sos-injectors

This project contains common public observation sources that are used to inject observation into a users SOS. This project is base off the [https://github.com/axiomalaska/sos-injection SOS Observation Injecter project] (below) to inject the observation into the SOS. The current sources that it pulls observation from are: HADS, NDBC, NOAA NOS CO-OPS, NOAA Weather, RAWS, SnoTel, and USGS Water. 

This project can be used by just downloading the pre-built jar from Github. Goto [https://github.com/axiomalaska/source-sos-injectors Github project] to learn more. 

= SOS Observation Injecter =
https://github.com/axiomalaska/sos-injection

The SOS Observation Injector is used to enter sensor observations into a SOS. This code is an adaptor from the model of how most groups store their data (Source/Station/Sensor) to allow observations to be placed in an SOS. The model I am referring to is one where there is a Source that contains many Stations. An example source would be NOAA. Each of those Stations contain one or more Sensors. And each of those Sensors reads one or more Phenomena. This code allows one to inject data into a SOS by implementing some interfaces that are geared towards the common Source/Station/Sensor model.
