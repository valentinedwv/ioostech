   * demo: http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/ThinSweClient2.0/Client.html
provides map-view of sensor locations, interactive graphing, and data export capabilities, works with pre-provided SOS services, however not with services above, probably requires specific response formats (?)

== GetCapabilities survey ==

An initial perl script to get the GetCapabilites document and had to manually tweak some of the response xml namespace info at the document beginning to get around some odd things which the version of LibXML I'm using doesn't handle well.

The perl script is at http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/ioos/get_sos.pl and the resultant GetCapabilities documents and processed files are at http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/ioos/out

Each organization in the current array list below like 'secoora' has a 'latest.txt.secoora' response corresponding to the getCapabilites response a summary file 'out_secoora' which is listed in a way for further post-processing - including platform locations and obs types, summary platform and observation type counts and kml/kmz file like 'secoora.kml' 'secoora.kmz' showing the platform locations and obs types at each location.
