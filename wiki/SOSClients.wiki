Web-based Thin Client: http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/clients/Thin_SWE_Client/index.html, demo: http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/ThinSweClient2.0/Client.html
provides map-view of sensor locations, interactive graphing, and data export capabilities
works with pre-provided SOS services, however not with services above, probably requires specific response formats (?)
