<h3>Goal:</h3>
<span style ="font-size:30px">Our goal is to create an inter-agency ocean acidification parameter list, which will be shared by all participating agencies, to facilitate OA data sharing.</span>

<h3>Current committee members:</h3>
   * Rob Ragsdale (IOOS)
   * Hassan Moustahfid (IOOS)
   * Emilio Mayoga (NANOOS/Univ. of Washington)
   * Sara Haines (SECOORA/UNC - CH)
   * Don Collins (NODC)
   * Hernan Garcia (NODC)
   * Liqing Jiang (NODC)
   * Alex Kozyr (CDIAC)
   * Cyndy Chandler (BCO-DMO) 
   * Dwight Gledhill (OAP)
   * Leticia Barbero (AOML)
   * Cathy Cosca (PMEL)
   
<h3>Parameter submission form:</h3>
Please <a href=https://docs.google.com/a/noaa.gov/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG1jN1RUY2xxSGxkMUdobzNvMkZ1d1E6MQ#gid=0>click here</a> to submit your parameters.

This interface enables you to submit new ocean acidification parameters to us. Once approved, the new parameters will be added to the interagency ocean acidification parameter list in the MMI. Before you submit any new parameters, we strongly recommend you to check against the <a href=http://mmisw.org/orr/#http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/OA>Interagency Ocean Acidification Parameter list</a> first, to make sure the parameters you are submitting are not already in the list. 

After the submission is completed, please send an email to {{{<ioos_nodc_chemical_vocabulary@googlegroups.com>}}}. This will start the review process.  

<h3>Repository of submitted parameters</h3>
To check out the parameters that are just submitted, please <a href=https://docs.google.com/a/noaa.gov/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkOD4kCLqux_dG1jN1RUY2xxSGxkMUdobzNvMkZ1d1E#gid=0>click here</a>. Your will need to sign in using your official NOAA mail or Gmail if your 

work email is not Gmail based.  

Newly submitted parameters will be stored here temporarily before they are approved into the Interagency Ocean Acidification Parameter List in the MMI. 

<h3>Proposed bylaws:</h3>
   * Committee members have up to two weeks to raise comments or objections on a submitted parameter. After that time, silence assumes consent.
   * After approval, the parameters will be published into the inter-agency OA parameter list that resides in MMI.

<h3>Inter-agency Ocean Acidification Parameter List</h3>
The approved ocean acidification parameters will be published in the <a href=http://mmisw.org/orr/#http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/OA>Interagency Ocean Acidification Parameter list</a>, which resides in MMI's website.

==Discussion==

Emilio Mayorga 21 January 2013

Sorry that I haven't contributed anything to these OA vocabulary
discussions for a long time. It's great to see it moving forward --
thanks for your continued efforts! I have some comments that follow on
several OA email threads and activities from Liqing, Hernan and Sara
over the last couple of months:

- I think it'd be very helpful to ourselves and our ability to
communicate what we're doing to have a wiki page where all relevant
documents, rules and resources are described or linked from. I'd be
happy to help with this. Any wiki will do, but I'd suggest using the
IOOS Google Code wiki at http://code.google.com/p/ioostech/, only b/c
Rob and I are already administrators and we know we can easily give
anyone write permission. This wiki page or pages should include text
from several of the great email exchanges we've had on this topic in
the last ~6 months, including the thread I'm replying to. BTW, these
pages don't have to be integrated with any other pages on that wiki
just yet, so we're free to mold it as we see fit (but we're probably
better off if we take advantage of other pages there).

- The Google spreadsheet needs an attribute for term name in the
vocabulary; this is not a name intended primarily for people, but
rather one that follows naming conventions that are appropriate for
computers. The CF parameter name is a great example. For example, it
probably should be limited to lower case (and of course, no blank
spaces). I think Sara and Rob have sent out some proposed naming
conventions for IOOS parameter terms; that and CF rules would be a
good place to start.

- In the parameter Google spreadsheet, Sara (or someone else?) added
this comment: "How should we deal with acronyms or chemical terms in
the term ID on MMI??  Initially, acronyms and chemical formulas were
frowned upon.  I can't remember the thinking.  Open to suggestions,
and comments." That's a very appropriate question to ask, to come up
with naming rules. Personally, I think forbidding molecular formulas
would be too limiting, and would create the nightmare of huge names
that CF has with many chemical parameters. Same goes for a variable as
widespread and widely known as pH. BTW, a few months ago I looked at
what variables existed for pH or acidity in CF and the IOOS parameter
vocabulary. I'd be happy to forward what I found if there's interest.

- We should start thinking of an MMI vocabulary mapping for OA. Some
OA terms will be taken from CF, some from existing terms on the IOOS
parameter vocabulary, and some will be added to the latter. The
vocabulary mapping brings it all together in a convenient way. We
could create a new one, or build on top of one of the mappings Sara
has set up for IOOS. I think I gave examples of this I few months ago
on an email. Something may already exist, I forget.

- Great comments from Sara on the parameter spreadsheet entries added
by Liqing. And very nice form for submitting parameter suggestions!

And with that, I go into hibernation again. I'm off to a meeting
pretty much all of this coming week (Delaware).

Not too late to say Happy New Year... Cheers,
-Emilio
