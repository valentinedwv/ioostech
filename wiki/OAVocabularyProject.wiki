<h4>Goal:</h4>
We aim to create an inter-agency ocean acidification parameter list, which will be shared by all participating agencies, to facilitate OA data sharing.

=Current committee members:=
Rob Ragsdale (IOOS)
Hassan Moustahfid (IOOS)
Emilio Mayoga (NANOOS/Univ. of Washington)
Sara Haines (SECOORA/UNC - CH)
Don Collins (NODC)
Hernan Garcia (NODC)
Liqing Jiang (NODC)

=Parameter Submission Interface:=
https://docs.google.com/a/noaa.gov/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG1jN1RUY2xxSGxkMUdobzNvMkZ1d1E6MQ#gid=0

- An underlying Google spreadsheet will hold the submitted parameters
before they can be input into the MMI. The Google spreadsheet will be
shared within the committee members.

- Committee members have up to two weeks to raise comments on a
submitted parameter. After that time, silence assumes consent.

- After approval, the parameters will be published into the
inter-agency OA parameter list.
