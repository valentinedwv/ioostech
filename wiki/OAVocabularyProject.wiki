<h3>Parameter Submission Interface:</h3>
https://docs.google.com/a/noaa.gov/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG1jN1RUY2xxSGxkMUdobzNvMkZ1d1E6MQ#gid=0

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
   * An underlying Google spreadsheet will hold the submitted parameters before they can be input into the MMI. The Google spreadsheet will be shared within the committee members.
      * To read submitted terms, Please click "Drive" on your Gmail and look for a Google spreadsheet with the name of "Parameter Submission Form"
   * Committee members have up to two weeks to raise comments or objections on a submitted parameter. After that time, silence assumes consent.
   * After approval, the parameters will be published into the inter-agency OA parameter list.
