Ingesting USGS data for [http://nvs.nanoos.org NVS] with Python, by using the WaterML 1.1 encoding option from the USGS water services. Done via the [http://hiscentral.cuahsi.org/ CUAHSI HIS catalog] and its SOAP services, but could also do this directly from the USGS REST WaterML web services.

Still using the earlier NWIS service(like http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/ ...) documented at

  The implementation is all wrapped up in the overall EOI Agent codebase - but the majority of the code for actually dealing with the USGS services is here: https://github.com/ooici-eoi/eoi-agents/blob/develop/src/net/ooici/eoi/datasetagent/impl/UsgsAgent.java

Folks at the the [http://www.twdb.state.tx.us/ Texas Water Development Board, TWDB] have developed a comprehensive Python package ([https://github.com/swtools/pyhis pyHIS]) to ingest WaterML data using [http://his.cuahsi.org/ HIS web services ("WaterOneFlow")]. The TWDB team lead for this project is Dharhas Pothina; [http://www.cuahsi.org/his-webinars.html Dharhas will give a webinar on pyHIS on Nov 15th, hosted by CUAHSI HIS,] that will be recorded and available afterwards.
