This document summarizes the CF Feature Types as part of the [SOSReferenceImplementationWorkshop] discussion.

Based on the [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html#idp6280704 CF 1.6 Conventions], we need to develop SWE encodings for the feature types in use by the IOOS community.  These have been identified as:

  * *timeSeries* - a series of data points at the same spatial location with monotonically increasing times
  * *timeSeriesProfile* - a series of profile features at the same horizontal position with monotonically increasing times
  * *trajectoryProfile* - a series of profile features located at points ordered along a trajectory
  * *trajectory* - a series of data points along a path through space with monotonically increasing times.  This has no Z dimension associated with it (path over a 2D plane over time).  It can be represented as a trajectoryProfile with a constant Z and P dimension.  

The solutions for encoding the above into SWE should *NOT* exclude the other CF Feature Types from being represented (it will be likely that these will be used to represent the above):

  * *point* - a single data point having no implied coordinate relationship to other points.  x(1), y(1), t(1).  *The can be represented as a timeSeries with a single data record*
  * *profile* - an ordered set of data points along a vertical line at a fixed horizontal position and fixed time.  *This can be represented as a timeSeriesProfile with a time dimension of length 1.*
  

CDL representation of the geometries can be found [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html#appendix-examples-discrete-geometries here].

It is worth mentioning here that NetCDF files in the CF 1.6 spec can only represent one featureType at a time.  If at all possible, this should not be a restriction of the SWE mappings.

NetCDF files can also represent data from multiple stations.  A timeSeries at multiple stations can be represented in one file.  I don't know how this will map to SWE.

The initial, draft SWE representations included in this wiki document were [http://external.opengis.org/twiki_public/NREwg/SWECommonNetCDFTutorial taken from the 2009 OGC wiki document, "SWE Common encoding of CF-NetCDF coverage data"]. Unfortunately, that document didn't get around to fleshing out *profile* and *trajectory* SWE Common encodings (or their corresponding time series, of course).

Here is the explanation of the different types of storage techniques:

== Other netCDF Issues  ==

 * General construct for mapping global attributes
 * More specific mechanism for certain types of information such as contact person
 * Generic construct for variable attributes
 * Specific variable attributes
   * standard_name
   * units
   * long_name
   * auxillary_variables
   * axis
 * Mapping the featureType = "timeSeries"; attribute to O&M (featureOfInterest?)
 * Mapping the cf_role=”timeseries_id” attribute to O&M
