= Introduction =

The IOOS Data Catalog (or, the catalog for short)is evolving along with the overall DMAC implementation across the regions.  That is, as we learn more about how the data access services that are being deployed in the regions work (SOS, THREDDS, ERDDAP etc), we're learning more about how best to build and deploy the catalog.  In the overall DMAC system, the requirements of the two subsystems (data access services, and data catalog services) are interdependent.  This page is intended to provide enough information about how the catalog works, to identify when requirements or issues for the data access services are present.
