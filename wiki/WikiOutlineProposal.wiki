#summary Proposal for an organization structure for some components of this wiki.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Purpose =

The primary purpose of this wiki is (comments? votes? alternatives?):
 * to record the unorganized but important issues and solutions arrived at in the course of the SOS Reference Implementation Working group
 * to house an in progress, but always up to date version of the SOS Interface Description Document that contains all the technical information necessary for a developer to either a. write client software to consume IOOS SOS, b. write server software implementing the IOOS profile (what's the correct word? Ioos Specification? ) of SOS
 * to be a technical repository for projects and related activities that use SOS or other data access services? (list of libraries, client software, training materials, demos, presentations?)
 * any/all of the above for each IOOS data access service including SOS, WMS, DAP (all flavors)
 * repository of technical information documenting the entire IOOS architecture including Service Registry, Geoportal, Data Catalog, GTS distribution of data, relationships between major entities etc etc.
 * repository of code implementing various common functions such as a general Python/Java/Matlab/C library of QARTOD algorithms.

    * EnvironmentalDataConnector
    * Proteus
    * pyOOS
    * JavaNetCDFIOSP
  * SOSServers
    * 52NorthSOS
    * ncSOS
    * DIF SOS
    * OostethysSOS
  * SOSGuidelines (IDD)
    * Request Parameters and usage
    * Response types (aka Templates)
    * SOSVocabularies (any SOS specific modifications or additions to the overall ControlledVocabularies page.
* ControlledVocabularies
     
Pieces to consider
# Record of the workshop
# More thorough crosswalk with CF Discrete Sampling Geompetries (we have many pages already
# Filling out the other big pieces of DMAC (RCV, Regional Portals)
# Playing well with others (ocean.data.gov and company)
# Intersections with the international programs
# Observing System specific stuff (CF netCDF template for gliders is almost done)
# More direct intersections with HFR/Waves
# Tools for anything (web harvesting resources, other clients)
# Training, demos, movies, mashups, example scripts
# Individual regional IDD noting difference with the generic IDD.
