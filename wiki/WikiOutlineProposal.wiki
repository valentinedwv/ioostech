#summary Proposal for an organization structure for some components of this wiki.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Purpose =

The primary purpose of this wiki is (comments? votes? alternatives?):
 * to record the unorganized but important issues and solutions arrived at in the course of the SOS Reference Implementation Working group
 * to house an in progress, but always up to date version of the SOS Interface Description Document that contains all the technical information necessary for a developer to either a. write client software to consume IOOS SOS, b. write server software implementing the IOOS profile (what's the correct word? Ioos Specification? ) of SOS
 * to be a technical repository for projects and related activities that use SOS or other data access services? (list of libraries, client software, training materials, demos, presentations?)
 * any/all of the above for each IOOS data access service including SOS, WMS, DAP (all flavors)
 * repository of technical information documenting the entire IOOS architecture including Service Registry, Geoportal, Data Catalog, GTS distribution of data, relationships between major entities etc etc.
 * repository of code implementing various common functions such as a general Python/Java/Matlab/C library of QARTOD algorithms.


= Suggested Outline for the High Level Wiki Navigation =

 * DataAccessServices
   * SOS
     * SOSClients
       * EnvironmentalDataConnector
       * Proteus 
       * PyOOS
       * JavaNetCDFIOSP
     * SOSServers
       * 52NorthSOS
       * ncSOS
       * DIF SOS (NDBC) Probably should be renamed.  Should these server pages be included underneatht the SOSGuidleines IDD so that the information can be version specific?
       * NANOOS Python SOS
       * OostethysSOS
     * SOSGuidelines (IDD)  (THE IDD OR WSDD MUST BE VERSIONED AND WILL REFER TO THE TEMPLATE MILESTONE VERSION.  KEEP LINKAGES FROM THIS PAGE MINIMAL TO KEEP APPLICABLE VERSIONS CLEAR)
       * SOSConcepts (definitions and common usage for observedProperty, featureOfInterest, procedure, and ObservationOffering)
       * Request Parameters and usage
       * Response types (aka Templates)
       * SOSVocabularies (any SOS specific modifications or additions to the overall ControlledVocabularies page.
   * OPeNDAP based services (Guidelines for use, not necessarly an all encompassing technical documentation.  Only IOOS specifics)
     * ERDDAP
     * THREDDS
     * Hyrax
     * PyDAP
   * WMS
 * ServiceRegistry
 * DataCatalog
 * SystemMonitor
 * SystemViewer
 * ControlledVocabularies
    * ObservedProperty (aka Parameter vocabularies.  Description and rules for choosing and managing terms)
    * PlatformVocabulary (Description and crosswalk with other concepts)
 * Metadata
 * FileFormats (Web Service agnostic discussion of file formats and data models relevant to them.  Mostly focused on netCDF and the so-called standards in use in that area (CF, Glider Files, Argo, OceanSITES, Discrete Sampling Geometries etc)    
  
Pieces to consider
  # Record of the workshop
  # More thorough crosswalk with CF Discrete Sampling Geometries (we  have many pages already
  # Filling out the other big pieces of DMAC (RCV, Regional Portals)
  # Playing well with others (ocean.data.gov and company)
  # Intersections with the international programs
  # Observing System specific stuff (CF netCDF template for gliders is almost done)
  # More direct intersections with HFR/Waves
  # Tools for anything (web harvesting resources, other clients)
  # Training, demos, movies, mashups, example scripts
  # Individual regional IDD noting difference with the generic IDD.
