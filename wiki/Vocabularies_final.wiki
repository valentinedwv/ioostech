= Introduction =

(This is place-holder text) Developers of IOOS services should strive to use Controlled Vocabularies whenever appropriate.  This page describes some options for Controlled Vocabularies to choose from, examples of how to implement them in various data formats and information about how to update existing vocabularies.  The material presented here should evolve into a policy but currently there are several open questions to be resolved.  


= IOOS Controlled Vocabularies =

IOOS has defined the use of specific controlled vocabularies for the following categories or concepts:
 * observed property
 * platform (asset) type
 * organization type
 * organizational role
 * keywords
 * units-of-measure

All vocabularies that IOOS has formally adopted or developed are hosted at the [https://marinemetadata.org/mmiswinfo/ MMI Ontology Registry and Repository (MMI ORR)]. A list of IOOS vocabularies and vocabulary mappings on MMI is available at [http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos].

== Observed Properties ==

IOOS supports the inclusion and standard referencing of a large set of observed properties (sometimes referred to as phenomena, parameters, or variables). Any property encompassed by the following two vocabularies is supported:
  # *[http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-standard-names/about Climate & Forecast (CF) Standard Names Parameter Vocabulary.]* The MMI vocabulary location is: http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter
  # *[TODO_IOOSVocabPage IOOS Parameter Vocabulary.]* A vocabulary created via an IOOS community polling of terms in use by RA's in 2009-2010, and a follow-up process of QA/QC, refinement and consolidation of duplicates. The MMI vocabulary location is: http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/parameter

_All references to parameters from these vocabularies should be done via MMI URL's_, such as  http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter/sea_water_temperature  or  http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/parameter/ammonia

=== Selecting a vocabulary term ===

For convenience and completeness, the IOOS Parameter Vocabulary incorporates CF terms that are widely used in IOOS. An MMI-based ontological mapping or cross-walk has been created between matching IOOS and CF terms, such that a reference to a term in one vocabulary is automatically linked to an appropriate term on the other vocabulary if such a match exists.

  * _The use of CF vocabulary references is encouraged (but not mandated) when a relevant term exists in that vocabulary._ This preference exists to support interoperability with the wider community using CF.
  * _When the desired term is not found on the CF vocabulary, an IOOS Parameter Vocabulary reference should be used._
  * _If the desired parameter is not found on either vocabulary_, see the section [#Terms_not_found_in_either_vocabulary "Terms not found in either vocabulary"], below.

=== Terms not found in either vocabulary ===

If the parameter is not on the CF or IOOS vocabularies, engage IOOS to add it to the IOOS vocabulary using a publicized and accepted process that's reasonably fast and not much of a burden on anyone involved. In parallel, IOOS will maintain an engagement with the CF community to discuss adding parameters that are not currently present. *(Need to provide instructions to service providers as to what to do in the short term: eg, include the observed property using a urn template similar to station identifiers, or the MMI IOOS url parameter reference? Or do not include the observed property until the term has been added to the IOOS vocabulary?)

=== Composite Properties ===

The CF standard names vocabulary only defines scalar properties. Previously, IOOS defined three composite ("vector") properties made up of two or more scalar properties: *winds*, *waves* and *currents*. These composite properties are supported via the IOOS Parameter Vocabulary, and will be referenced like any other term there, eg:  http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/winds


== Platform Types ==

(To be added later)

== Organization Types ==

Two kinds of organization or institutional classifiers are formally recorded: *IOOS Partners*, and *Sector Types*.

=== IOOS Partners ===

IOOS data providers that include IOOS Regional Associations (RAs) and Federal Agencies should be referenced using standard RA and agency acronyms (GLOS, SECOORA, USACE, etc) as listed in the MMI-hosted organization vocabulary at http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/organization. MMI URL references such as http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/organization/SECOORA must be used when appropriate, as described below; the RA acronym on this URL is case sensitive and must be all uppercase.

*Usage in SOS XML responses: [TO-DO: the Response entries will be linked to SOS response templates, so that full usage details are readily accessible]*

|| *SOS Operation* || *Request* || *Response: XML block (XPath)* || *Comment* ||
|| GetCapabilities || - || /sos:Capabilities/ows:ServiceIdentification/ows:Keywords/ows:Keyword  || *Required*. RA keyword must be the first keyword listed [*Eric, is this still true?*]. ||
|| GetObservation  || - || - || No RA reference. ||
|| DescribeSensor || - || `*` /sml:classification/sml:ClassifierList/sml:classifier[name="ParentNetwork"]/sml:Term[definition="urn:ioos:def:classifier:NOAA:parentNetwork"]/sml:value || *Required*. Also use <sml:codeSpace xlink:href="http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/organization"/> ||
||         "       || - || `*` /sml:contact[xlink:role="urn:ogc:def:classifiers:OGC:contactType:publisher"]/sml:ResponsibleParty/sml:organizationName || *Optional*. Use if data are distributed via RA-hosted data service. ||

=== Sector Types ===

IOOS Organizational Societal Sector types should reference the MMI hosted sector vocabulary at http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/sector. The terms distinguish between different segments of government, for example, federal, state and municipal, academic and tribal, and industry divisions.  This vocabulary does not distinguish from non-US organizations as such, and should be applicable within their national contexts; for example, a Canadian provincial agency can be described as "gov_state".

Examples of IOOS Organizational Sector terms listed:

  *Government
  *Tribal
  *Academic
  *Industry
  *International
    *"International" providers will be handled via the specification 
of a country name in the SensorML Operator role contact information.

== Keywords ==

Including geographical regions?


= Other relevant concepts =
== Other Organization Role ==
(Mainly in SensorML)
Service provider, data provider, asset owner.

== Units of Measure ==

Units of Measure are not actually a vocabulary per se, but are rather a mix of vocabulary terms and syntax for combinations. Recommend (but not mandate) use of [http://unitsofmeasure.org/ UCUM] or [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/ UDUNITS]. But versions must be kept in mind (eg, UDUNITS-1 vs UDUNITS-2).
