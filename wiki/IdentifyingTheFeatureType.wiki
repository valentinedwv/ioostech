#summary How to identify the FeautureType in the !GetObservation responses
= Introduction =


One thing the group has been trying to figure out (Shane, you probably missed this discussion) is a good way to distinguish in the GetObservation responses which Featuretype is actually being returned.  As far as I can tell, we will need 6 different outputs.

!PointCollection - although seldom used
!ProfileCollection -although seldom used
!TimeSeriesCollection
!TimeSeriesProfileCollection
!TrajectoryCollection
!TrajectoryProfileCollection

But how should we represent that?  I didn't include it in my SWE examples, because frankly I wasn't happy enough with any of the options.

Since the contents of the {{{<om:Observation>}}} block will be different depending on the type, we need to include it there (at the top level) and can't just include it in the {{{<om:result>}}} section (the meat).
