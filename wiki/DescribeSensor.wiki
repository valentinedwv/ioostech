= Introduction =

Currently this page is just a dumping ground of links relevant to _SensorML_ and/or _DescribeSensor_

= Q2O: QARTOD to OGC =

Project home page is here.  http://q2o.whoi.edu/  One key idea relevant to the SensorML discussion is that Q2O has separated the platform/sensor metadata into two or more hierarchies based on the time scale in which the metadata is updated.  They can be referenced from within through xlinks.  For example, the _OEM_ file, or Original Equipment Manufacturer file, contains static metadata for a sensor that represents metadata that a) never changes and/or b) represents the factory defaults (these may change through time).  A second file, is a time dependent _Deployment_ file that contains metadata relevant to a particular deployment of the sensor in the environment.  I think this is an idea worth pursuing.

= Marine Metadata Initiative =

Go to http://marinemetadata.org and search sensorml, there are many resources.

Additionally, Carlos Rueda at MMI has been working on a web service to create SensorML documents.  I don't know how capable it is but according to his comments on the SensorML mailing list he has been working on it lately (Oct 2011).  I hope this means that he's willing to engage if we have questions and possibly even respond to requests.  http://mmisw.org/smlmor/
