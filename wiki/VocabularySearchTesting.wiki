= Introduction =

Most catalog services provide some search mechanisms of the metadata fields.  However, these tend to be limited to exact matches but not able to find data that is somewhat related or same data that is labeled differently.  Searching for like or similar terms is an important step towards improving the search capability within data catalogs like THREDDS or geoportal catalog services.  In this section, IOOS is testing automated search and discovery of terms based on relationships established in mapping vocabulary.
