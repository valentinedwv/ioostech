[http://www.ioos.gov IOOS] - [http://www.nanoos.org NANOOS] - [http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/ OTN] - POST (Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Network)

The purpose of this project is to engage in small-scale collaboration with important emerging data providers of both physical and biological observations-the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project.


== Objectives and Tasks to be addressed in this project ==
The project objectives are to:
  # Extend, adopt and implement data and metadata standards and data services for animal acoustic telemetry observations.
  # Implement a standard approach for exposing these observations and information via web services.
  # Develop limited, regional, accessible online products for browsing and visualizing such data, based on a customer-specified set of requirements.
To ensure relevance and future extensibility, this project will involve potential customers drawn from POST and NANOOS stakeholders (particularly fisheries state agencies) as well as NOAA partners. We will seek broad community participation in technical discussions and priority-setting exercises related to the execution of project objectives. IOOS and NANOOS leadership will ensure adherence to IOOS DMAC recommendations and extensibility to other groups, datasets and regions.

This project will build on existing [http://www.ioos.noaa.gov/data/welcome.html IOOS DMAC guidance and activities regarding biological and broader oceanographic data access].


== Project Documents and Reports ==
These documents are currently in various stages, from draft to completed.
  # Statement of Work
  # [http://ioostech.googlecode.com/files/POST_DataSystemDescription_DRAFT1.0.doc POST Data System Description]
  # Requirements: Survey results and initial requirements synthesis
  # Brief comparison of some existing systems
  # Content Standard: A metadata convention for animal acoustic telemetry data (document and tables)
  # System Design, including diagrams


== Project Data Services ==
Data Services being implemented by this project are based on [http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html ERDDAP] and [http://geoserver.org GeoServer]. Configuration files and instructions to set up ERDDAP and GeoServer instances for AAT data will be provided at the end of the project.

*ISO Dataset metadata (the 19115-related family):*
[https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_FAQ#What_are_all_of_these_numbers.3F Here's a nice summary of the differences between the inter-related metadata standards (19139, 19115, 19115-2)], from the NOAA Geo-IDE site. But note that it doesn't address the Marine Community Profile (MCP) of ISO 19115, mentioned below. Here's a summary of the 4 standards or profiles.

  * ISO 19115 is the main geospatial metadata standard that [http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/fgdc-iso-activities "describes the general content of the metadata and relationships between metadata elements. It does not, however, provide any guidance on how the metadata records should be built and formatted."]
  * [http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/fgdc-iso-activities ISO 19139 provides the XML encoding schema implementation for ISO 19115.] So, 19115 is the content model, 19139 is the packaging.
  * But ISO 19115-2 has emerged in IOOS as the ISO standard of choice for environmental datasets. [https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_FAQ#What_are_all_of_these_numbers.3F "Unfortunately, the name of 19115-2 is a bit misleading. It is essentially an extension of 19115 that adds information about missions, platforms and sensors, along with a few other things. Most environmental observations involve sensors, so 19115-2 is probably the right standard to use for most environmental datasets, not just imagery or gridded data."]. It is the ISO dataset metadata standard used by ERDDAP.
  * Around 2008, the Australian Ocean Data Centre defined a Marine Community Profile (MCP) of ISO 19115. MCP [http://www.aodc.org.au/index.php?id=37 "supports the documentation and discovery of marine spatial datasets and forms the foundation of the Marine Catalogue. The MCP has been developed in accordance with the rules established by the International Standard ISO 19115 Geographic information - Metadata. The MCP is a subset of the standard and includes all ISO 19115 core metadata elements. In addition, the MCP has defined supplementary elements, codelists and controlled vocabularies to assist in the description of marine resources."]. OTN is using the MCP.
