= Python SOS Data Services =

We're in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28zodiac%29 Year of the Water Snake] (Feb 2013 on). Big things are bound to happen in the world of Python services for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_serpent marine] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_anaconda hydrological] data.

== Events and opportunities in the near future ==

  * [http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/ SciPy 2013, Austin, June 24-29]. Could be good chance to meet with WOFpy/ulmo gang, and bring in Kyle (pyoos), too?! An opportunity to have a *"Water Python services" mini summit*?! Also to entice Chris Barker, Rich Signell, Rob Hetland, Tom Kralidis (OWSLib, pycsw), Roberto Almeida, Jeff Horsburgh (CUAHSI HIS) and others? Yeah!
  * I'd like to get in touch with IOOS, IOOS Python geeks, the Texas WOFpy/ulmo gang, and others to set up a webex conference call (on the IOOS webex) to get these linkages and communications started. Mid to late May 2013?

== Key "high-level" libraries & code ==

Roughly ordered from higher to lower level, in focus.

  * [NANOOSNVSPythonSOS NANOOS SOS]. Server software.
  * [https://github.com/swtools/ WOFpy/ulmo/pyhis group]. Based in Austin. Centered around the CUAHSI HIS stack (WOF/WaterML), though not exclusively.
    * [https://github.com/swtools/WOFpy WOFpy]. Server software, for CUAHSI HIS water data services: WaterML 1.0 + WaterOneFlow (WOF) 1. Note that WOFpy implements HTTP GET requests (REST-like, but using parameter-argument pairs), unlike the original WOF 1 specifications and most implementations out there. [http://waterservices.usgs.gov/ FYI, USGS also has a GET WOF 1 implementation.]
    * [https://github.com/twdb/ulmo ulmo]. Client software. (Replaces the now-deprecated "pyhis" package, developed by the same group)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/istsos/ istSOS]. Server software.
  * [https://github.com/asascience-open/pyoos pyoos]. Client software.
  * [http://geopython.github.com/OWSLib/ OWSLib]. Mostly client. Thanks to Kyle Wilcox (ASA), it now includes SOS & SensorML requests and parsing, and WaterML 1.0/1.1 parsing.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/ netcdf4-python]. Mostly client.
  * [http://pydap.org Pydap]. Server/Client.
  * [http://cfpython.bitbucket.org/ cf-python]. Package that implements the CF data model for reading, writing and processing of data and its metadata. Installation also deploys these two shell utilities (built on cf-python) for inspecting and combining datasets: _cfdump_ (view CF fields) and _cfa_ (create aggregated CF datasets). [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ioos_tech/yNSDQw1vWkA/h8JuEhjiOzgJ Derrick mentioned these tools on an ioos_tech email from 4/24/2013.]


== Mailing lists and groups ==

  * [http://librelist.com/browser/pywaterdata/ pywaterdata email list]. Currently limited to the WOFpy/ulmo/pyhis group (ie, mainly CUAHSI HIS hydro data services)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/waterpython/ Water Python Google Code group]. Never really got off the ground after a bit of enthusiasm back in early 2010 (Chris Barker, Rob Hetland, etc). But could be repurposed....
  * [http://oceanpython.org/ oceanpython.org], from OTN

== Core elements ==
  * [http://pycsw.org/ pycsw] (already supports GET(KVP), POST(XML) and SOAP requests)
  * [https://github.com/swtools/WOFpy WOFpy] (In collaboration with WOFpy/ulmo TWDB group, support WaterML 1.x (and WOF services) and WaterML 2.0 + SOS 2)
  * [https://github.com/asascience-open/paegan paegan]
  * [http://geopython.github.com/OWSLib/ OWSLib]


= Other relevant, but somewhat tangential efforts =

  * [http://scitools.org.uk Scitools]. Run by the UK Met Office. Python libraries intended to interact with CF datasets (Iris package) and generate commonly needed oceanographic data plots more readily (Cartopy package). Very cool stuff. [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ioos_tech/91VLT0GLXKE/discussion Here's a 4/12/2013 thread on ioos_tech list, where Derrick mentioned this].
