= Python SOS Client & Server architecture =

_An initial scratchpad. I'll grow this incrementally. -Emilio_

== Events and opportunities in the near future ==

  * [http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/ SciPy 2013, Austin, June 24-29]. Could be good chance to meet with WOFpy/ulmo gang, and bring in Kyle from pyoos, too?! A *"Water Python services" mini summit*? Yeah!

== Key "high-level" libraries & code ==

Roughly ordered from higher to lower level, in focus.

  * [NANOOSNVSPythonSOS NANOOS SOS]. Server software.
  * *[https://github.com/swtools/ WOFpy/ulmo/pyhis group]. Based in Austin.*
    * [https://github.com/swtools/WOFpy WOFpy]. Server software, for CUAHSI HIS water data services: WaterML 1.0 + WaterOneFlow (WOF) 1. Note that WOFpy implements HTTP GET requests (REST-like, but using parameter-argument pairs), unlike the original WOF 1 specifications and most implementations out there. [http://waterservices.usgs.gov/ FYI, USGS also has a GET WOF 1 implementation.]
    * [https://github.com/twdb/ulmo ulmo]. Client software. (Replaces the now-deprecated "pyhis" package, developed by the same group)
  * [https://github.com/asascience-open/pyoos pyoos]. Client software.
  * [http://geopython.github.com/OWSLib/ OWSLib]. Mostly client.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/ netcdf4-python]. Mostly client.
  * [http://pydap.org Pydap]. Server/Client.

== Mailing lists and groups ==

  * [http://librelist.com/browser/pywaterdata/ pywaterdata email list]. Currently limited to the WOFpy/ulmo/pyhis group (ie, mainly CUAHSI HIS hydro data services)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/waterpython/ Water Python Google Code group]. Never really got off the ground after a bit of enthusiasm back in early 2010 (Chris Barker, Rob Hetland, etc). But could be repurposed....
