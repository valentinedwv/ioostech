= Day Two = 

== Day One Wrap Up ==

Emilio will lead a [SOSRefImplementWorkshop_Day1Agenda short wrap up of Day 1 activities].

== Common Data Model (CF/SWE/O&M) ==

(Kyle) Part 1: [CFFeatureTypes O&M / SWE Common encoding for the scientific feature types defined by CF conventions / the Common Data Model.]

=== Requirements ===

  * Support multiple observedProperties and offerings, even if offerings are on different frequencies.  How should we represent the different offerings?
    * MultipleBlocks
      # Less fill values.  Each offering only has to return the observedProperties that apply to itself, not all of them that are requested.
      # Multiple CSV blocks means more output parsing and POTENTIALLY more verbose output.
      # Offerings are *usually* on a common frequency, resulting in even less fill values.
    * SingleBlock
      # Less description metadata since it is all encompassed in one block.
      # More fill values for offerings that do not support all requested observedProperties.
      # Offerings on different reporting frequencies can further increase the verbosity of the output.

  * Output format needs to be useable by the community
    * IOOS GML was not the solution, too verbose
    * CSV has has positive reception
    * Need to add metadata block to CSV output so it is completely self describing.
=== The Time Block ===

[TheTimeBlock How to describe times in the responses.]


=== The Position Vector Block ===

[TheVectorBlock How to describe the position of an asset] inside of {{{<om:result>}}} block.
