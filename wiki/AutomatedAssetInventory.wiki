#summary Docs and Info about the IOOS Automated Asset Inventory

= Introduction =

A comprehensive inventory of observational assets is critical to the continued development of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and is a mandate of the ICOOS Act of 2009.  The Asset Inventory will serve as an important tool to document changes to U.S. IOOS observing capabilities and Data Management and Communication (DMAC) services in future years, to assist with DMAC initiatives, to respond to budgetary inquires, to inform real-time operations, to provide information about U.S. IOOS for communication and outreach purposes, and to facilitate gaps analyses.  To avoid requesting yearly or sub-yearly inventories from Regional Associations (RAs), we propose leveraging existing DMAC investments to take advantage of IOOS-sanctioned web services that the RAs are already expected to develop.  Yet, the information in the Asset Inventory will only be as good as the metadata from which the information is drawn.  Continued attentiveness to metadata maintenance through communication between dataset providers and regional and federal web service providers is needed to ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of the Asset Inventory.  Overall, the development of the Asset Inventory will require minimal additional responsibility by regional and federal partners associated with the IOOS network but should greatly benefit the entire U.S. IOOS community.
