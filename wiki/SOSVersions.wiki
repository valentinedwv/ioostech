#summary Information about the versions and development history of various SOS's

Please if possible provide information on how the SOS you are using was developed or its origins(Oostethys,NDBC,etc)  If your SOS is altered from a reference implementation(Oostethys,NDBC,52 North,etc) please describe or provide documentation link(s) to how and why it is different(additional features,work with existing skills/environment,etc).

I've listed a GetCapabilities link from the earlier SOS endpoint listing document - if there are additional GetCapabilities,DescribeSensor,GetObservation sample links you would like to share or documentation links, please feel free to add those also.

The goal is to develop hopefully a small handful of SOS implementation references and function/feature profiles that can be the source of possible updates or changes discussion.

We have an older(2009) Oostethys version and a 'DIF' version which is a copied response format of the initial NDBC DIF SOS version.
