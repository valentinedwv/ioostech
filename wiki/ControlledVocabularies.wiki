#summary Information about selecting and using Controlled Vocabularies for developers of IOOS services.
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design,Vocabularies

= Introduction =

Developers of IOOS services should strive to use Controlled Vocabularies whenever appropriate.  This page describes some options for Controlled Vocabularies to chose from, examples of how to implement them in various data formats and information about how to update existing vocabularies.  The material presented here should evolve into a policy but currently there are several open questions to be resolved.  

The closest thing to policy we currently have is that IOOS data providers should use the [http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov Climate and Forecast Standard Names] when referring to variables (used synonymously with parameters here).  This applies to both netCDF files and to the various outputs of an SOS service (i.e. as column headings in a CSV file). [Requirement Requirement]

However, there is also a vocabulary developed during the Data Integration Framework project by Matt Howard, Sara Haines and others which has been titled the IOOS Parameter Vocabulary.  Both the [http://mmisw.org/orr/#http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter CF table] and version 1.0 of the [http://mmisw.org/orr/#http://mmisw.org/ont/ioos/parameter IOOS Parameter Vocabulary] are currently hosted (v1.0) at the [http://mmisw.org/orr/#b MMI Ontology Registry and Repository].  

= Issues and Open Questions =

  # Which vocabularies should be used in what situations?
  # How are deficiencies identified, documented and passed along to the right people so that they can be addressed. (e.g. if you have a new term not on any existing list, who do you tell and what will they do about it?)
  # How can we be good stewards in the community and participate in the process without bringing progress to a grinding halt?  (e.g. create temporary solutions for the immediate term but *ensure* that the long term vocabulary maintenance is done too.)
  # How do we harmonize with the many other vocabularies that have been developed in the regions?

==Water Quality==

==IOOS NCCOS Water Quality Data Project==

The IOOS Program has been working with NOAA's National Center for Coastal Ocean Sciences (NCCOS) on water quality data access and delivery.  A significant step in this project has been to reconcile the terms for the data set for this project.  CF terms have been identified for the variables that have been defined.  There is some overlap with the IOOS Parameter Vocabulary registered with MMI.  The majority of parameters that make up this data set have not been defined by CF.  

This is the list of [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkuvBG1lfvfMdHZVV1ZKLVN4YUJvQ0t0NVFTZVl3VEE&hl=en_US#gid=0 Draft Water Quality Terms]  defined for the project with NCCOS.  (The parameters collected by the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, also listed below, has been incorporated.)  The data is collected by Florida International University's Southeast Environmental 

Are there vocabularies that can be used to augment this list?  Are the definitions the right definitions for the water quality community?  Research Center.

==CMSP Discovery Vocabularies Workshop==
December 1-3, 2010
WHOI (With USGS/NOAA sponsorship)
http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=49656
Workshop report is available from the page above or directly from http://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=77984&pt=2&p=84468

There was useful information gathered prior to the meeting and included in the appendices of the report on existing Crosswalks, Repositories, Metadtaa Standards, Tools, and Vocabularies in use.  Most important for IOOS, are some firm recommendations on how to choose vocabularies and the importance of a mature process for extending/updating vocabularies when they do not meet our exact needs.  

Matt Howard and some others from the IOOS community are exploring how best to extend IOOS vocabularies into the biogeochemical and water quality domains.

==IOOS Biological Data Project==
Hassan Moustahfid from the IOOS PO led a project with three agencies in Hawaii aimed at developing a common exchange data format for exchanging reef fish survey data (presence, absence, abundance of reef fish as determined by visual sampling procedures).  A large part of that development involved agreeing on vocabularies to be used by all three agencies.  The solution was an extension of the Darwin Core standard for biological observations and was developed in conjunction with OBIS USA.

How do we use this?  Is it extensible?  What about the overlap with existing standards like CF and the IOOS Param Voc?  

Biodiversity Information Standards (formerly known as Taxonomic Data Working Group) http://www.tdwg.org/

Schema Terminology will be based on ratified [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/ Darwin core], Dublin core and proposed IOOS vocabularies. XML guide will also based on Darwin core XML guidance.


•CF Conventions had been applied to biological data definition at the field level. This is to assure that IOOS Biological Project will be compatible with other geophysical datasets.


•FGDC and ISO 19115-2 are the adopted Metadata standards.


•ERDDAP is the main webservice for this project.


•EDC is the client developed to connect directly to ERDDAP and access data using customer application tools such as ARCGIS and R Project.
