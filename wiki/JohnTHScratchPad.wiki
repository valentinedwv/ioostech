===Musings on identifying IOOS Assets using GC, DS, GC===

<b>Situation:</b> Asset owned by RA1<br>
<b>Anticipated Result:</b> operatorSector in DS is...?

<b>Situation:</b> Asset located in RA1, but data provided through RA2 and RA1<br>
<b>Anticipated Result:</b> For the RA2 responses, keyword in GC is RA2.  parentNetwork in DS is also RA2.  Does a field contain RA1?

<b>Situation:</b> Asset owned by ACE, operated by SCRIPPS, provided by RA1<br>  
<b>Anticipated Result:</b> Keyword in GC is RA1, operatorSector in DS is academic, publisher in DS is RA1.  Where is ACE listed?

<b>Situation:</b>  Asset owned/operated by SCRIPPS, data provided by NDBC<br>
<b>Anticipated Result:</b> operatorSector in DS is academic.  Publisher and parentNetwork are likely listed as NDBC.  Where is the RA affiliation located?  If an asset is not owned, operated, and provided by a federal agency, is the RA affiliation required to be noted in parentNetwork and/or publisher?

<i>Note:</i> Do we want to include PlatformMobility and PlatformEnvironment in the DS templates?  Ideally the PlatformEnvironment could be derived from the PlatformType, but the PlatformMobility maybe cannot.

<i>Note:</i> Not sure if I should be surprised by this, but the gml:id in GC is not specified using a URN.  Yet, the sml:id in DS is specified using a URN.  Conversely, the gml:name in GC and DS is specified using a URN and the sml:name in DS is not necessarily specified using a URN.

<i>Note:</i> Where do we include information about the QA/QC for certification, in addition to other reasons?<br><br>

===Useful Reports Generated From NGDC ISO Metadata in the Service Registry===

A record in the registry is one dataset for DAP services but a service endpoint (containing multiple datasets) for SOS services.  Will need a way of combining DAP datasets when creating summary reports
