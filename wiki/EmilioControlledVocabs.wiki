#summary From Emilio: Some pointers, links and initial thoughts on Controlled Vocabularies
#labels NANOOS,Vocabularies

= Introduction =

My intent here is to complement the [ControlledVocabularies more official page on Controlled Vocabularies] elsewhere on this wiki, without adding my clutter to that page.

The SURA Modeling Testbed tool at http://testbedwww.sura.org/model-dev/ has a really interesting combination of models and data (I think) where controlled vocabularies for measurements are used. It's worth assessing these, chatting with people in that team (ASA, Kyle Wilcox??), etc. For example, it's clear to me that while many/most of the names used are in fact CF standard names, many must be made up, but using CF recommendations for building names.

Other controlled ontologies / controlled vocabularies (some less controlled than others...) directly relevant to IOOS DMAC:
  # *CF resources on MMI*. I've found several pages and resources at MMI that are directly focused on CF, but may not be well integrated or cross-linked and have different degrees of currency (out of date).
    * [http://marinemetadata.org/references/cfstandardnames CF - Climate and Forecast Standard Names; Vocabulary for CF parameters] (a document, not a vocabulary resource per se)
    * [http://marinemetadata.org/community/teams/vocdev/generaldocuments/orrcf Using the ORR CF Standard names Vocabulary]
    * [http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter Climate and Forecast (CF) standard names parameter vocabulary]

  # *IOOS-specific parameter vocabularies on MMI*
