#summary Documentation for the IOOS SOS developed by Axiom based on 52North.org
#labels SOS


This project, carried out by Axiom Consulting and Design, in collaboration with IOOS, aims to augment the 52North.org SOS server code base with modifications that IOOS has deemed important.  To accomplish this, Axiom developers have [https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/main/SOS/Service/branches/ioos-sos/  forked the 52North server] and are adding new capabilities.  Periodically 52North will review changes in the IOOS branch for potential incorporation back in to the [https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/main/SOS/Service/trunk/ 52North trunk].

Feel free to experiment with example requests. Data is reset whenever new code is checked in.

Lance's SOS injection code is available here:

sos-injection is the Java toolkit for pushing data into the SOS via RegisterSensor and InsertObservation requests.

source-sos-injectors is a Scala project that harvests sensor data from web sources and uses the sos-injection module to push the data to an SOS.
