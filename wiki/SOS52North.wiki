#summary Documentation for the IOOS SOS developed by Axiom based on 52North.org
#labels SOS


This project, carried out by Axiom Consulting and Design, in collaboration with IOOS, aims to augment the 52North.org SOS server code base with modifications that IOOS has deemed important.  To accomplish this, Axiom developers have [https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/main/SOS/Service/branches/ioos-sos/  created an SVN branch of the 52North SOS code] and are adding new capabilities.  Changes that are applicable to all user groups (i.e. not specific to IOOS needs) are submitted back to the [https://svn.52north.org/svn/swe/main/SOS/Service/trunk/ 52North SOS trunk].

Feel free to experiment with example requests. Data is reset whenever new code is checked in.

Lance's SOS injection code is available here:

sos-injection is the Java toolkit for pushing data into the SOS via RegisterSensor and InsertObservation requests.

source-sos-injectors is a Scala project that harvests sensor data from web sources and uses the sos-injection module to push the data to an SOS.
