== Introduction ==
 
The Platform Vocabulary is being developed to give oceanographic data users consistent terminology to use for their data sets.  The Platform Vocabulary is an essential part of fulfilling the development of the IOOS SOS templates.  However, version 1.0 of the templates were complete without final guidance on the controlled vocabulary used in the templates to describe platformType.  This was unavoidable as we had to make progress.  The immediate goal is to complete the platform vocabulary before release of the version 1.1 and it is expected the vocabulary will be resolved before that.  For the record, Emilio, John Ten Hoeve, Rob R. and Sara Haines, to date, have been most active in developing the vocabulary.  If you are interested please, contact Rob Ragsdale (Rob.Ragsdale@noaa.gov) or John Ten Hoeve (John.tenhoeve@noaa.gov).

== Platform Vocabulary Use Cases ==
IOOS has drafted use cases to help derive requirements for the IOOS Platform Vocabulary.  These use cases are draft examples and include an initial set of guidelines for the vocabulary.   

  # The Program Office has a requirement to report assets in broad categories (e.g. buoys, HF radars, fixed stations near or on the coasts) for data calls and budgetary reports.  The platform vocabulary should be hierarchical so that the assets may be reported according to few large classes (less than 10).
  # Definitions for the platform vocabulary must be prescriptive to avoid misclassification.  In the previous version of the IOOS Asset Inventory, similar assets were assigned different platforms across the Regional Associations.  
  # If sensor information is not populated in the appropriate fields in sensorML, this sensor information may have to be provided in the platform vocabulary.  For example, a CTD may be on a vessel or a shore station, but if that information probably will not be included in the sensor metadata, then it may have to be included in some way iin the platform vocabulary.  Webcams are another good example of this.
  # The platform vocabulary must be able to handle mixed platforms (combined shore sensors measuring water temperature and met sensors measuring wind speed). Maybe this isn’t really a mixed platform and is instead should be called “Fixed Station”?
  # If a hierarchical structure is used for the vocabulary, the platform must be able to be uniquely identified using the MMI framework, and the structure should be transparent.  For example, if wave buoy is a subclass of buoy, and the Platform Type is listed as wave buoy, then the XPath provided should direct you to a page where wave buoy is noted as a subclass of buoy.  

== Platform Vocabulary Guidelines ==
  # No capitalization
  # No acronyms (High Frequency Radar)
  # A procedure is described for how the hierarchy is structured.  

== Example of Proposed Hierarchical Structure ==
A hierarchical structure has been proposed for the Platform Vocabulary in order meet reporting requirements, for example from the IOOS Asset Inventory or IOOS Catalog.  Here is an example to provide context to this proposal:

==Animal Platform Terms==

Scientific name and common name.  For example, if common name = northern elephant seal and if scientific name = Mirounga angustirostris, the platform term would be a combination of the two.  We recommend to use both common names and scientific names so that it can be searched by either.
The scientific and common name for animals can be found here URL: http://www.marinespecies.org/


==Discussion Forum==

*Sara Haines - 11/28/12*

The Platform Vocab wiki page is a great start.  The use cases really help to understand what the issues are.  Nice addition. Here are my  questions and comments to consider (mostly with regard to the table and but also to help refine use cases).
 
1. Are cameras and radars sensors? Should we classify stations with subclass HFR and webcam stations

2. A cabled array is a set of platforms. 

3. Drifters, buoys, and floats?? not sure how to categorize or map with fixed-station, fixed-profiling, profiling, profile-drifting types of these platforms (discuss more)

4. There should be definitions for each of the platform types (this might help the above comments and questions)


*John Ten Hoeve - 11/29/12*

Thanks for the comments Sara.  You bring up a lot of good points that Rob and I were struggling with here.  

1. We were particularly struggling with the compromise between having accurate terms for platforms but also employing jargon that people have already used.  HFR is a great example, as you noted.  It's technically a sensor, but what would be the platform?  Shore station possibly?  That's why I initially included it as a platform in the table to be more specific.  

2.  I agree with your take on cabled array - it's really a set of platforms but I'm not sure how data from cabled arrays will be handled through web services yet, for instance, SOS.  Will each element of the array be considered a different platform in the world of SOS (i.e. a different DescribeSensor file for each subsurface mooring of the cabled array?)  If so, then the cabled array may be a network and the individual elements, platforms?  In that case, cabled array maybe wouldn't have to be in the platform vocabulary?

3.  I also had trouble with buoys, drifters, floats, and moorings.  I agree that this need some thought.  My best attempt was in the table on the wiki.

4.  I agree that definitions would help a lot

5.  Another issue with the hierarchical framework is that if the lowest element of the hierarchy is used to populate the PlatformType field, then there may be similar terms used across different branches of the hierarchical tree.  I know that in SOS at least you could trace the hierarchy by using the MMI reference, but it still may be confusing for people who only want to look at the term.  Is it worth it to make terms more explicit?  In other words, instead of "Fixed Station"/"Inland Station"/"Dock" in the hierarchy, have a term like "Fixed Station - Inland Station - Dock"


*John Ten Hoeve - 12/13/12*

Some thoughts from the teleconference today:

1.  One of the primary goals is a list of terms and precise definitions

2.  Do we want a hierarchical structure a flat structure?

3.  The vocabulary should be consistent with the international community

4.  Look to other vocabularies for examples and guidance

5.  Hassan's Comment: We need a list of synonyms for the platform vocabulary and we should also be mindful of the specific attributes of those platforms

*John Ten Hoeve - 01/02/13*

Another thought while reading regional progress reports: Since one mooring platform name can have surface and bottom nodes, there may be a need for a term that describes these types of platforms.
