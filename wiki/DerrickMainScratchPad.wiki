#summary Dumping ground for Derrick's half baked ideas and TODO items.



 # Need a plan to document/address the units of measure issue.  There is conflicting guidance and IOOS doesn't seem to have a stated position yet.
   # How do you reference different uom vocabularies within the various types of files, e.g. GetCapabilities response and a netcdf file.
   # Update the DescribeSensor page to reflect the outcome of the Baltimore workshop including adding links to the templates Kyle started in the source repo.
 # Track the complete set of outstanding actions that pop up usu through the course of email discussion.  The urge to get services implemented is pushing the finalization of the templates and we are losing track of issues.  This was supposed to be done with the issues function on the wiki but we need a way to track these better.
 # IOOS and/or provider specific disclaimer.  Suggest this is a provider issue initially.
 # Mike Garcia asked about encoding wave spectra information.  We need a better strategy for this and a way to include the expertise of CDIP and the netCDF feature folks at NODC who are currently working with CDIP to archive their data.
